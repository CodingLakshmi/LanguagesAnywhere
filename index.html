      Provide free and accessible language education resources for anyone with internet access. 
      </br>
      </br>
      How? Starting with the simple idea of creating a website, we expanded that idea into a website to tutor people in languages, later adding the idea of quizzes. Eventually we decided to create this website to help make learning languages online a seamless, completely free experience for people by organizing a curriculum into a digestable page of content.

            Chinese is one of only two world languages to be spoken by over a billion people. With over 900 million native speakers, Chinese is one of the most used mother tongues. It is also one of the oldest languages still in use, with basics dating back as far as the Shang Dynasty (1600-1046 BCE). Being such a widely spoken and well known language makes Chinese an attractive option for many Westerners when choosing a new language to learn.
